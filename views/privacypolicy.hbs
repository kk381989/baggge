     <h4>Policy for unregistered users</h4>
     <p>We encourage you to register with us to get exceptional services and offers. Do register with us to book
     services on our website and to take advantage of our customization features and seasonal offers. However,
     you may also choose not to register and take advantage of any feature of our site where registration is
     not required.</p>
     <p>If you do not register,information collected from you is limited.</p>
     <p>We log your IP address in order to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our Web site and
     track usage statistics.</p>
     <p>Your IP address may vary each time you visit, or it may be the same, depending on whether you access our
     site through an always-on type of Internet connection (e.g., cable modem or DSL), or through a dial-up
     connection (e.g., VSNL, MTNL etc). Either way, it would be extremely difficult for us to identify you
     through your IP address, and we make no attempt to do so.</p>
     <p>If you reached our site by clicking on a link or advertisement on another site, then we also log that
     information. This helps us to maximize our Internet exposure, and to understand the interests of our users.
     All of this information is collected and used only in the aggregate; that is, it is entered into our database,
     where we can use it to generate overall reports on our visitors, but not reports about individual visitors.</p>
     <p>We also place a small file known as a “cookie” on your computer’s hard drive. A cookie may contain information
     that allows us to track your path through our Website and to determine whether you have visited us before.
     However, unless you register with us, it contains no personally identifiable information that would allow us
     to identify you. Cookies cannot be used to read data of your hard drive, and cannot retrieve information from
     any other cookies created by other Websites. We use cookies in this manner to help us understand how visitors
     use our site, and to help us to improve our site. You may refuse to accept a cookie from us by following the
     procedures specific to your Web browser. Although you may do so, you may find that your browser reacts
     strangely when visiting not only our Web site, but other Web sites as well. Since cookies don’t provide us
     with any information from which we can identify you, we suggest you allow us to place one on your computer.</p>
     <p>If you visit our site by “clicking-through” from a site operated by one of our partners, and you have
     registered with that partner, then certain information about you that you have provided to that partner may
     be transmitted to us. You should review the privacy policy of the Website from which you reached our site
     in order to determine what information was collected and how you agreed that our partner could use that
     information. Regardless of what information was transmitted to us, however, we don’t keep it unless you
     register with us.</p>

     information described above. That personal information may include your name, email address, mailing address,

     vary, but we only collect the information that you manually enter into our forms. We may store all or some
     of that information in a cookie file on your hard drive, so that our system will recognize you each time
     you visit our site. In that way, we can save your preferences from visit to visit and present you with a
     customized Web site, without requiring you to log into our site every time you visit. To improve services
     and enhance personalization, we may periodically obtain information about you from other independent third
